# What is this repo?

- This repo is where I save each chapter of `data structure and algorithm` as notebook with visual images and example code to illustrate how each part works.
- In each folder there will be a `.md` file which save the content. All images and practice exercise code will be save in `img` and `code` folders. 

# What are the chapters?

- I will keep updating new content as far as I've learned and summarized.

- `Data Structure`:
    - Big-O Notation
    - Single linked list
    - Doubly linked list
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Tree:
        - Binary tree
        - Binary search tree
        - Tree traversal
        - Complete binary tree (heap)
    - Graph (updating...)
    - Others:
        - Struct
        - Vector
        - Set
        - Hashmap (Hash table)

- `Algorithm`:
    - Recursion
    - Seaching: 
        - Linear search
        - Binary search
    - Sorting:
        - Bubble sort
        - Selection sort
        - Insertion sort
        - Merge sort
        - Heap sort
        - Quick sort

# Is there a website for this repo?

- The website will have both content and sidebar compiler to write code. I will make it in the future (or maybe not).
