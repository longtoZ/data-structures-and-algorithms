# What is this repo?

- This repo is where I save each chapter of `data structure and algorithm` as notebook with visual images and example code to illustrate how each part works.
- In each folder there will be a `.md` file which save the content. All images and practice exercise code will be save in `img` and `code` folders. 

# What are the chapters?

- I will keep updating new content as far as I've learned and summarized.

- `Data Structure`:
    - Single linked list.
    - Doubly linked list.
    - Stack.
    - Queue.
    - Tree:
        - Binary tree.
        - Binary search tree.
    - Graph (updating...)

- `Algorithm`:
    - Updating...

# Is there a website for this repo?

- The website will have both content an sidebar compiler to write code. I will make it in the future (or maybe not).
